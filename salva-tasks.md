# Salva's Independent Tasks - SauberNow Setup Guide

## üöÄ Priority 1: Supabase Setup (Complete Before Next Coding Session)

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create New Project

1. Once logged in, click "New Project"
2. Choose your organization (or create a new one)
3. Fill in project details:
   - **Project Name**: `saubernow-production` (or similar)
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password and **save it securely**
   - **Region**: Choose Europe (Frankfurt or Ireland for best performance in Austria)
4. Click "Create new project"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for project initialization

### Step 3: Get Project Credentials

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Navigate to "API" section
3. Copy and save these values **securely**:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **Service role key** (starts with `eyJ...`) - Keep this **SECRET**

### Step 4: Enable Authentication

1. Go to "Authentication" in the sidebar
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Configure:
   - **Site URL**: Set to `http://localhost:3000` for now
   - **Email confirmations**: Enable (for production security)
   - **Email auth**: Ensure it's enabled
4. In "URL Configuration":
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/**` to redirect URLs
   - Add to site URLs

### Step 5: Email Configuration (Optional for MVP)

For now, you can use Supabase's built-in email service. Later, you may want to configure:

- SMTP settings for custom email provider
- Email templates customization

### Step 6: Create Environment File Template

Create a file called `.env.local.template` in your project root with:

```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### Step 7: Security Setup

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to "Settings" ‚Üí "API"
2. Note the JWT Settings - we'll need these later
3. Keep your service role key **extremely secure** - never commit it to git
